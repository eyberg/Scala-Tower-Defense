what is this?

a desktop tower defense clone written
in scala

see: http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/game3.asp
( if you don't mind wasting half of your life away)

HOWTO Play:
  there really is nothing to play yet

what you need:

  * scala

  * a color terminal (unless you are living in your cave
  and still use a monochrome monitor I'm assuming you
  have this -- the game really won't be fun w/out it)


TODO:
  * allow user too choose between creeps and towers
  * multiplayer online? heads up and so forth?
  * fix table layout
  * convert enemy position to x,y coords
  * convert tower position to x,y coords
  * add in tower class
  * add in enemy class
  * start adding in some proper testing
  * should not have to press enter for input
  * create screen formatter to deal with formatting
    everything correctly
  * update pause to set timer to infinite
  * toggle for logging
  * figure out some way to place towers w/out memorizing
    the board -- cursor based arrow keys??
  * maybe use http://code.google.com/p/specs/ ?
